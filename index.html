                    Dong En is a motivated and independent student who works hard towards his personal goals. He is passionate in the aspects of business and finance, and displays analytical and problem -solving skills by actively seeking new knowledge during his studies.

                    Dong En often takes the initiative to help his classmates in need during lessons and is able to exert a positive influence on his peers. Leading as the captain of the basketball CCA, he is also actively involved in organising school events such as the combined sports camp for different sports CCAs and sports carnival for children from various kindergarten centres near our school. His positive attitude puts him in good stead towards greater success.

                    In the basketball training sessions over the last 4 years, captain Dong En has provided excellent support to the coaches and teachers. Outside of the CCA hours, he dedicated his time and effort to ensure that his teammates develop themselves physically and upgrade their skills continously. By optimising the training hours and insisting on good discipline, the team improved under his strong leadership. He was persistent in his approaches and was able to make the unpopular but right moves that help the team to progress. As a strong positive influence on his juniors as well as his peers, his never-say-die attitude would impact the rest to continue to work hard and gravitate towards a stronger performance in future competitions.
